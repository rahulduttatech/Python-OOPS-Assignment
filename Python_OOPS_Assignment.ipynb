        "\n",
        "**Classes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "For example, a Car class might define properties like color, make, model, and methods like start() or stop().\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objects:**\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that is created based on the structure defined by its class.\n",
        "For example, if Car is a class, then my_car = Car() creates an object my_car of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "It is typically achieved by using access modifiers like private or protected to hide data, ensuring that it cannot be changed directly from outside the class. This provides data security and simplifies code maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called a superclass or base class).\n",
        "This helps in code reuse and creating a hierarchical relationship between classes. For example, a Truck class can inherit from the Vehicle class and gain access to properties and methods of Vehicle.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polymorphism:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even if they belong to different subclasses. It enables a single method or function to work with different types of objects.\n",
        "For example, different classes like Dog and Cat can inherit from a Animal class, and both can have a method speak(). Even though the speak() method behaves differently for each, polymorphism allows calling speak() on any Animal object without needing to know the specific type of animal.\n",
        "These concepts work together to allow for a structured and modular approach to programming, making code easier to understand, extend, and maintain"

        "1. **Class Definition**:\n",
        "   - The `Vector` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the `x` and `y` coordinates of the vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Overriding `__str__`**:\n",
        "   - The `__str__` method returns a formatted string that represents the vector in a human-readable form, e.g., `Vector(2, 3)`.\n",
        "   - This method is called when you use the `print()` function or `str()` on an instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Overriding `__add__`**:\n",
        "   - The `__add__` method defines how two `Vector` objects can be added together using the `+` operator.\n",
        "   - It checks if the other object is an instance of `Vector`. If so, it returns a new `Vector` whose coordinates are the sum of the two vectors' coordinates.\n",
        "   - If the other object is not a `Vector`, it returns `NotImplemented`, which allows Python to handle the operation in a way that maintains the expected behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What These Methods Allow You to Do:\n",
        "- **`__str__`**: Provides a way to control how instances of your class are represented as strings. This is especially useful for debugging and logging, as it allows you to format the output in a readable manner.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **`__add__`**: Enables the use of the `+` operator to add instances of your class together. This makes the class behave more like built-in types and allows you to use intuitive operations with your custom objects.\n",

        "   - The `time_decorator` function takes another function (`func`) as an argument and defines an inner function `wrapper` that will replace the original function.\n",

        "\n",

        "   - `start_time` captures the current time before calling the original function.\n",

        "4. **Returning the Original Function's Result**:\n",
        "   - The result of the original function is returned so that it can still be used as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Using the Decorator**:\n",
        "   - The `@time_decorator` syntax is used to apply the decorator to `slow_function` and `add_numbers`.\n",
        "   - When `slow_function()` is called, it will take about 2 seconds to complete, and the execution time will be printed.\n",

        "1. **Static Method (`is_leap_year`)**:\n",
        "   - The `@staticmethod` decorator is used to define the static method `is_leap_year`.\n",
        "   - This method takes a single argument, `year`, and checks if it satisfies the leap year conditions.\n",

        "2. **Leap Year Logic**:\n",
        "   - The method checks:\n",
        "     - If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or\n",
        "     - If the year is divisible by 400.\n",
        "   - If either condition is true, the method returns `True`, indicating that the year is a leap year. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",

        "   - The example demonstrates checking several years (2024, 1900, and 2000) to see if they are leap years.\n",
        "   - The output indicates whether each year is a leap year or not.\n",
